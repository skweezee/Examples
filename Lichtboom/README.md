## Getting Started

You need the following materials to create this Skweezee:

* Four soft objects, filled with soft conductive material
* An Arduino (with four Skweezee shields in parallel) with running Skweezee sensing code
* NeoPixel LED strings or rings (needs additional code to create animations)

Connect all materials, download the Arduino sketch ‘lichtboom.pde’, and run on your Arduino.

## How To Play

Press any of the four pillows, and control a NeoPixel animation with the output of this sketch.
